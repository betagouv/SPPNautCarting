        :cvar METRE: The metre (or meter) is the base unit of length in the
            International System of Units (SI). It is defined as the
            distance travelled by light in vacuum in 1/299,792,458 of a
            second.
        :cvar FOOT: A foot (plural: feet) is a non-SI unit of length in a
            number of different systems including English units, Imperial
            units, and United States customary units. The most commonly used
            foot today is the international foot. There are three feet in a
            yard and 12 inches in a foot.
        :cvar METRIC_TON: The tonne or metric ton (U.S.), often redundantly
            referred to as a metric tonne, is a unit of mass equal to 1,000
            kg (2,205 lb) or approximately the mass of one cubic metre of
            water at four degrees Celsius. It is sometimes abbreviated as mt
            in the United States, but this conflicts with other SI symbols.
            The tonne is not a unit in the International System of Units
            (SI), but is accepted for use with the SI. In SI units and
            prefixes, the tonne is a megagram (Mg). The Imperial and US
            customary units comparable to the tonne are both spelled ton in
            English, though they differ in mass. Pronunciation of tonne (the
            word used in the UK) and ton is usually identical, but is not
            too confusing unless accuracy is important as the tonne and UK
            long ton differ by only 1.6%.
        :cvar TON: Long ton (weight ton or imperial ton) is the name for the
            unit called the "ton" in the avoirdupois or Imperial system of
            measurements, as used in the United Kingdom and several other
            Commonwealth countries. It has been mostly replaced by the
            tonne, and in the United States by the short ton. One long ton
            is equal to 2,240 pounds (1,016 kg) or 35 cubic feet (0.9911 m3)
            of salt water with a density of 64 lb/ft¬≥ (1.025 g/ml). It has
            some limited use in the United States, most commonly in
            measuring the displacement of ships, and was the unit prescribed
            for warships by the Washington Naval Treaty‚Äîfor example
            battleships were limited to a mass of 35,000 long tons (36,000
            t; 39,000 ST).
        :cvar SHORT_TON: The short ton is a unit of weight equal to 2,000
            pounds (907.18474 kg). In the United States it is often called
            simply ton without distinguishing it from the metric ton (tonne,
            1,000 kilograms) or the long ton (2,240 pounds / 1,016.0469088
            kilograms); rather, the other two are specifically noted. There
            are, however, some U.S. applications for which unspecified tons
            normally means long tons (for example, Navy ships) or metric
            tons (world grain production figures). Both the long and short
            ton are defined as 20 hundredweights, but a hundredweight is 100
            pounds (45.359237 kg) in the U.S. system (short or net
            hundredweight) and 112 pounds (50.80234544 kg) in the Imperial
            system (long or gross hundredweight).
        :cvar GROSS_TON: Gross tonnage (GT) is a function of the volume of
            all ship's enclosed spaces (from keel to funnel) measured to the
            outside of the hull framing. There is a sliding scale factor. So
            GT is a kind of capacity-derived index that is used to rank a
            ship for purposes of determining manning, safety and other
            statutory requirements and is expressed simply as GT, which is a
            unitless entity, even though its derivation is tied to the cubic
            meter unit of volumetric capacity. Tonnage measurements are now
            governed by an IMO Convention (International Convention on
            Tonnage Measurement of Ships, 1969 (London-Rules)), which
            applies to all ships built after July 1982. In accordance with
            the Convention, the correct term to use now is GT, which is a
            function of the moulded volume of all enclosed spaces of the
            ship.
        :cvar NET_TON: Net tonnage (NT) is based on a calculation of the
            volume of all cargo spaces of the ship. It indicates a vessel‚Äôs
            earning space and is a function of the moulded volume of all
            cargo spaces of the ship.

            Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) is based on

            on a mathematical formula to calculate a vessel's total volume;
            a PC/UMS net ton is equivalent to 100 cubic feet of capacity.
        :cvar SUEZ_CANAL_NET_TONNAGE: The Suez Canal Net Tonnage (SCNT) is
            derived with a number of modifications from the former net

        :cvar DRAUGHT: The depth of water necessary to float a vessel fully
            loaded. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_measurements; 24 July
            2010)
        :cvar HEIGHT: The height of the highest point of a vessel's
            structure (e.g. radar aerial, funnel, cranes, masthead) above
            her waterline. (UKHO NP100/2009)
        :cvar DISPLACEMENT_TONNAGE: A measurement of the weight of the
            vessel, usually used for warships. (Merchant ships are usually
            measured based on the volume of cargo space; see tonnage).
            Displacement is expressed either in long tons of 2,240 pounds or
            metric tonnes of 1,000 kg. Since the two units are very close in
            size (2,240 pounds = 1,016 kg and 1,000 kg = 2,205 pounds), it
            is common not to distinguish between them. To preserve secrecy,
            nations sometimes misstate a warship's displacement.
            (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_measurements; 24 July 2010)
        :cvar DISPLACEMENT_TONNAGE_LIGHT: The weight of the ship excluding
            cargo, fuel, ballast, stores, passengers, and crew, but with
            water in the boilers to steaming level.
            (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_measurements; 24 July 2010)
        :cvar DISPLACEMENT_TONNAGE_LOADED: The weight of the ship including
            cargo, passengers, fuel, water, stores, dunnage and such other
            items necessary for use on a voyage, which brings the vessel
            down to her load draft.
            (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_measurements; 24 July 2010)
        :cvar DEADWEIGHT_TONNAGE: The difference between displacement, light
            and displacement, loaded. A measure of the ship's total carrying
            capacity. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_measurements; 24
            July 2010)
        :cvar GROSS_TONNAGE: The entire internal cubic capacity of the ship
            expressed in tons of 100 cubic feet to the ton, except certain
            spaces with are exempted such as: peak and other tanks for water
            ballast, open forecastle bridge and poop, access of hatchways,
            certain light and air spaces, domes of skylights, condenser,
            anchor gear, steering gear, wheel house, galley and cabin for
            passengers. (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_measurements; 24
            July 2010)
        :cvar NET_TONNAGE: Obtained from the gross tonnage by deducting crew
            and navigating spaces and allowances for propulsion
            machinery.(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_measurements; 24
            July 2010)
        :cvar PANAMA_CANAL_UNIVERSAL_MEASUREMENT_SYSTEM_NET_TONNAGE: the
            Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS) is based on
            net tonnage, modified for Panama Canal purposes. PC/UMS is based
            on a mathematical formula to calculate a vessel's total volume;
            a PC/UMS net ton is equivalent to 100 cubic feet of capacity.

        :cvar SUEZ_CANAL_NET_TONNAGE: the Suez Canal Net Tonnage (SCNT) is
            derived with a number of modifications from the former net
            register tonnage of the Moorsom System and was established by
            the International Commission of Constantinople in its Protocol
            of 18 December 1873. It is still in use, as amended by the Rules
            of Navigation of the Suez Canal Authority, and is registered in
